# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview 

Leverage TensorFlow and design neural network to predict whether loan applicants will be successful if funded.

## Results

The results of this v1 are not optimal, as expected. A bad combination of high loss at 72% and low accuracy at 53%.

## Summary

We can achieve much better prediction results as we continue data preprocessing and model configuration.
